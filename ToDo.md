### CK's Filter List todo

- [ ] [Project Improvements via GitHub App integration enhancement help wanted #4](https://github.com/CHEF-KOCH/CKs-FilterList/issues/4) (high-prio)
- [ ] Remove redundant entries and replace it with more intelligent syntax rules which works for all websites (high-prio)
- [ ] Make categories for Porn, Malware, etc. to easier work with the list - Split all in separate folders/categories. (high-prio)
- [ ] Finish Readme.md and Wiki (mid-prio) **working on it**
- [ ] [Fix all reported issue](https://github.com/CHEF-KOCH/CKs-FilterList/issues) (high-prio)
- [ ] Maybe add an description like !Facebook before each entry (related to ^^) (low-prio) I prefer no or less comments and backlinks, no one read them anyway and there not helpful at all cause the filter lists are so big that you need to search manually anyway.
- [ ] Merge the 0.9 GB Hosts list I collected over 17 years into the project (low-prio) (some stuff already merged and optimized [redundant stuff removed])
- [ ] Add missing DNS66 16x16 ico. (low-prio)
- [ ] Find the last 20 audio ads server which I couldn't catch the first time (low-prio)
- [ ] Facebook added new autoplay video ads in his Chat-App Messenger, need to investigate into this (lowest-prio since it's unclear if Facebook keeps this, I only can imagine how many people must now pissed of because of such BS)
- [ ] Find a better logging method to exclude IP's from HOSTS file and store them in a separate file. (mid-prio)
- [ ] Maybe remove duplicates in the Game filter list (not sure if needed)
